"""
We check that a string is EITHER of the form (digit)(zero or more '-')(digit)
OR has exactly one `*`. As we have a multi-line string, we use of `^...$`
to delimit the start/end of the matching string.

Altough we have 4 groups per match, we get either:
* group(1)...group(3) when matching `n-..-n`, `group(4)` is empty
* group(4) when matching `*`, group(1)...group(3) are empty.

We expect to have exactly nsamples matches if the previous subsitution 
is correct.
